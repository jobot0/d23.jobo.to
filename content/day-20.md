## What's going on here?
> The Old Town of **R'Gonteh**, made of strong wood and solid rocks. Its story goes back 2000 years in the past when the ancestors of the current inhabitants, the **Ugons**, travelled to find the Sacred Flame.
> Inhabitants believe the volcano they live on is their main "Old Spirit". The **Brew Keeper** is the main governor of the city. It has to be a chaman studiying the geothermy for all this life. Many try every ten year to become the new one.
> To do so, contestants need to succeed to bring some obsidian rock still warm (or at least they can make believe it is). 
> R'Gonteh is one of the main nation in the region, it has a strong trade relationship with **Ralako√Ø**. Most of its citizen are trolls or orcs.
